#' Compute accumulation between forecast lead times
#'
#' For data with equally spaced lead times, the difference between, or
#' accumulation of gridded fields between lead times is computed. The time over
#' which to compute the accumulation must be set and is calculated from the lead
#' times. If lead times are not equally spaced an attempt will be made to
#' compute all accumulations for the desired accumulation time from the
#' available lead times.
#'
#' This function would typically be used compute accumulations between lead
#' times for model outputs that are accumulated from the model start time, such
#' as precipitation and fluxes. However, \code{accumulate} could also be used
#' to compute the change in any value between lead times, such a change in
#' temperature or change in wind speed for example.
#'
#' @param .fcst A harp_fcst list or a harp_spatial_fcst data frame.
#' @param accum_time The time over which to compute the accumulation. Must be in
#'   the same units as the lead_time column.
#' @param ... Further arguments passed to or from methods.
#'
#' @return An object of the same class as .fcst with the accumulations computed.
#'   Rows for lead times for which it is not possible to compute the
#'   accumulation are dropped.
