\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Date of the first forecast to be read in. Should be in
YYYYMMDDhh format. Can be numeric or charcter.}

\item{end_date}{Date of the last forecast to be read in. Should be in
YYYYMMDDhh format. Can be numeric or charcter.}

\item{det_model}{The name of the deterministic model. May be expressed as a
vector if more than one model is wanted.}

\item{parameter}{The parameters to read as a character vector. For reading
from vfld files, set to NULL to read all parameters, or set
\code{veritcal_coordinate = NA} to only read surface parameters. See
\code{show_harp_parameters} to get the possible parameters.}

\item{lead_time}{The lead times to read as a numeric vector.}

\item{by}{The time between forecasts. Should be a string of a number followed
by a letter (the defualt is "6h"), where the letter gives the units - may
be d for days, h for hours or m for minutes.}

\item{file_path}{The path for the forecast files to read. file_path will, in
most cases, form part of the file template.}

\item{file_format}{The format of the files to read. Can be "vfld", "grib",
"netcdf", "fa", or "fatar".}

\item{file_template}{The file template for the files to be read. For
available built in templates see \code{\link{show_file_templates}}. If
anything else is passed, it is returned unmodified, or with substitutions
made for dynamic values. Available substitutions are {YYYY} for year,
\{MM\} for 2 digit month with leading zero, \{M\} for month with no leading
zero, and similarly \{DD\} or \{D\} for day, \{HH\} or \{H\} for hour,
\{mm\} or \{m\} for minute. Also \{LDTx\} for lead time where x is the
length of the string including leading zeros - can be omitted or 2, 3 or 4.
Note that the full path to the file will always be file_path/template.}

\item{stations}{A data frame of stations with columns SID, lat, lon, elev. If
this is supplied the forecasts are interpolated to these stations. In the
case of vfld files, this is ignored and all stations found in the vfld are
used. In the case of gridded files (e.g. grib, netcdf, FA), if no data
frame of stations is passed a default list of stations is used. This list
can be accessed via \code{station_list}.}

\item{correct_t2m}{A logical value to tell the function whether to height
correct the 2m temperature forecast, if it is included in the
\code{parameter} argument, from the model elevation to the observation
elevation. The default is TRUE.}

\item{keep_model_t2m}{A logical value to tell the function whether to keep
the original 2m temperature from the model as well as the height corrected
values. If set to TRUE the this parameter gets the name "T2m_uncorrcted".
The default is FALSE.}

\item{lapse_rate}{The lapse rate, in Kelvins per meter, to use when height
correcting the 2m temperature. The defaul is 0.0065 K/m.}

\item{vertical_coordinate}{If upper air for multiple levels are to be read,
the vertical coordinate of the data is given here. The default is
"pressure", but can also be "model" for model levels, or "height" for
height above ground /sea level.}

\item{clim_file}{The name of a file containing information about the model
domain. Must include orography (surface geopotential), but can also include
land-sea mask.}

\item{clim_format}{The file format of \code{clim_file}. Can be "grib", "fa",
"fatar", or "netcdf".}

\item{interpolation_method}{The interpolation method to use. Available
methods are "bilinear", "bicubic", or "nearest". The default is "nearest",
which takes the nearest grid points to the stations.}

\item{use_mask}{A logical value to tell the function whether to include a
land-sea mask in the interpolation. The land-sea mask must exist in either
the \code{clim_file} or in the forecast files.}

\item{sqlite_path}{If not NULL, sqlite files are generated and written to the
directory specified here.}

\item{sqlite_template}{The template for the filenames of the fctable files.
See \code{\link{show_file_templates}} for available built in templates -
for forecast sqlite files, these are templates beginning "fctable_". The
default is "fctable_det".}

\item{sqlite_synchronous}{The synchronus setting for sqlite files. The
defualt is "off", but could also be "normal", "full", or "extra". See
\url{https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous} for more
information.}

\item{sqlite_journal_mode}{The journal mode for the sqlite files. The default
is "delete", but can also be "truncate", "persist", "memory", "wal", or
"off". See \url{https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode} for
more information.}

\item{return_data}{A logical indicating whether to return the read data to
the calling environment. The default is FALSE to avoid memory overload.}

\item{...}{Extra options depending on file format.}
