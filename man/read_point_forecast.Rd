\title{Read point forecasts from FCTABLE files}
\usage{
read_point_forecast(start_date, end_date, fcst_model, fcst_type, parameter,
  lead_time = seq(0, 48, 3), lags = "0s", merge_lags = TRUE,
  by = "6h", file_path = ".", file_template = NULL,
  drop_any_na = TRUE, stations = NULL, members = NULL,
  accumulate = TRUE, vertical_coordinate = c(NA_character_, "pressure",
  "model", "height"), get_lat_and_lon = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Date of the first forecast to be read in. Should be in
YYYYMMDDhh format. Can be numeric or charcter.}

\item{end_date}{Date of the last forecast to be read in. Should be in
YYYYMMDDhh format. Can be numeric or charcter.}

\item{fcst_model}{The forecast model to read - this is typically used to
construct the file name. Can be a character vector of model names.}

\item{fcst_type}{The type of forecast to read. Set to "det" for deterministic
or "eps" for ensemble.}

\item{parameter}{The forecast parameter to read. This is usually only used to
construct the filename, and in accumumlating precipitation.}

\item{lead_time}{The lead times to be retrieved. Can be used to construct the
file names and to set which lead times are retrieved.}

\item{lags}{The lags that were used when the forecast was run. If, for
example, the FCTABLE files are constructed from lagged model runs the lags
must be given here to ensure that the correct file names are generated. If,
however, you simply want to add lagged members to a forecast, you should do
that using \link[harpPoint]{lag_forecast}.}

\item{merge_lags}{A logical that, if set to TRUE (the default), lagged
ensemble members will be shifted in time and joined to the parent forecast
as derived from \code{start_date} and \code{by}.}

\item{by}{Used in constructing the file names. A string of a number followed
by a letter (the default is "6h"), where the letter can be "d" for days,
"h" for hours, "m" for minutes and "s" for seconds. Should be set to the
fastest varying time dimension in the desired file names.}

\item{file_path}{The path to the data.}

\item{file_template}{The template for the file names of the files to be read
from. This would normally be one of the "fctable_*" templates that can be
seen in \link{show_file_templates}. Can be a single string, a
character vector or list of the same length as \code{fcst_model}. If not
named, the order of templates is assumed to be the same as in
\code{fcst_model}. If named, the names must match the entries in
\code{fcst_model}.}

\item{drop_any_na}{Set to TRUE (the default) to remove all cases where there
is at least one missing value. This ensures that when you come to analyse a
forecast, only those forecasts with a full set of ensmeble members / data
are read in. For reading lagged ensembles, this is automatically set to
FALSE. The cases with at least one missing member are then dropped when the
lagged members are created using \link[harpPoint]{lag_forecast}.}

\item{stations}{The stations to retrieve forecasts for. This should be a
vector of station ID numbers. Set to NULL to retrieve all stations.}

\item{members}{The members to retrieve if reading an EPS forecast. To select
the same members for all forecast models, this should be a numeric vector.
For specific members from specific models a named list with each element
having the name of the forecast model and containing a a numeric vector.
e.g. \cr \code{members = list(eps_model1 = seq(0, 3), eps_model2 = c(2,
3))}. \cr For multi model ensembles, each element of this named list should
contain another named list with sub model name followed by the desired
members, e.g. \cr \code{members = list(eps_model1 = list(sub_model1 =
seq(0, 3), sub_model2 = c(2, 3)))}}

\item{accumulate}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether to automatically accumulate
parameters based on the accumulation time. Set to FALSE if the data to be
read in have already been accumulated.}

\item{vertical_coordinate}{If upper air for multiple levels are to be read,
the vertical coordinate of the data is given here. The default is
"pressure", but can also be "model" for model levels, or "height" for
height above ground /sea level.}

\item{get_lat_and_lon}{Logical indicating whether to also extract the
latitude and longitude of the point forecasts from the sqlite files.}
}
\value{
A list with an element for each forecast model, or in the case of a
  multi model ensemble, another list with an element for each sub model. The
  list elements each contain a data frame with columns for station ID (SID),
  the forecast initialisation time (fcdate), the lead time (leadtime), the
  time for which the forecast is valid (validdate), and a column for the
  forecast with a heading of the model name in the case of a deterministic
  forecast, or multiple columns with heading names usually of the form
  \code{<model_name>_mbrXXX}, where XXX is the member number, in the case of
  an ensemble forecast.
}
\description{
Reads point forecasts from an sqlite file produced by
\link{read_eps_interpolate} or \link{read_det_interpolate}. The function
generates the file names from the start date, end date, forecast model(s),
parameter, lead time etc. supplied as arguments. The members, stations,
forecast dates and lead times to be retrieved from the files can also be
passed as arguments.
}
\details{
In the case of lagged forecasts, no lagged members are created at this stage,
but the \code{lags} argument is used to ensure that all of the necessary data
for creating lagged members are read in.
