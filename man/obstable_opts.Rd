\description{
OBSTABLE files are sqlite files containing four tables - SYNOP for "synop"
observations, TEMP for "temp" observations, synop_params for metadata about
the contents of SYNOP and temp_params for metadata about the contents of
TEMP. Note that data do not have to strictly be "synop" or "temp"
observations, but rather SYNOP contains near surface observations and TEMP
contains vertical profiles.
