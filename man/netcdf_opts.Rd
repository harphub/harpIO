\arguments{
\item{options_set}{A set of pre-defined options that can be returned.
Currently only available for data at MET Norway.}

\item{proj4_var}{The variable that holds the projection information in the
NetCDF files. Set to 0 if the proj4 string is a global attribute.}

\item{proj4_att}{The attribute of \code{proj4_var} that holds the proj4
string.}

\item{proj4}{If the proj4 string is not available from the NetCDF files it
can be set here. Set to "wrf" to get the proj4 string from WRF output
files. Note that if \code{proj4 = NULL} then an attempt will be made to get
the proj4 string from \code{proj4_var} and \code{proj4_att}. If proj4 has
any value other than NULL, \code{proj4_var} and \code{proj4_att} will be
ignored.}

\item{x_dim}{The name of the x dimension.}

\item{y_dim}{The name of the y dimension.}

\item{lon_var}{The name of the longitude dimension. This is needed to get the
southwest and northeast corners of the domain. Set to NULL if not available
and an attempt to will be made to get the corners from x_dim and y_dim and
the projection information.}

\item{lat_var}{The name of the latitude dimension. This is needed to get the
southwest and northeast corners of the domain. Set to NULL if not available
and an attempt to will be made to get the corners from x_dim and y_dim and
the projection information.}

\item{x_rev}{Set to \code{TRUE} if data in the x direction are in reverse
order.}

\item{y_rev}{Set to \code{TRUE} if data in the y direction are in reverse
order.}

\item{x_pos}{The position of the x dimension in multi dimensional arrays.}

\item{y_pos}{The position of the y dimension in multi dimensional arrays.}

\item{z_pos}{The position of the z (vertical) dimension in multi dimensional
arrays.}

\item{time_pos}{The position of the time dimension in multi dimensional
arrays.}

\item{member_pos}{The position of the ensemble member dimension in multi
dimensional arrays.}

\item{z_var}{The name of the z (vertical) dimension.}

\item{member_var}{The name of the ensemble member dimension.}

\item{time_var}{The name of the time dimension.}

\item{ref_time_var}{The name of the variable holding the forecast reference
time. Set to NA if it is to be derived from the first value in the time
dimension.}

\description{
When reading NetCDF files in harp, the system needs to know some information
about the structure of the NetCDF files. In order to get the domain
information it needs to know about the projection and the location of the
domain and in order to read the correct data it needs to know the names and
order of the dimensions.
}
\details{
Note that the order of the dimensions is "Fortran order" rather than "C"
order. This means that the order of the dimensions is obtained by reading
from right to left in the output of ncdump -h <filename>.

The default options can be seen by running \code{netcdf_opts()}, but there
are also some options sets that can be selected, currently only those for
data held at MET Norway and WRF output files.
